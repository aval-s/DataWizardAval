									<h3>Forecast Analyst</h3>
									<p> Arctic Glacier Canada Inc.</p>
									<span class="date">June 2022 - Dec 2023</span>
									<p>I took on the role of a forecasting hero. I crafted a smart demand predicting system that slashed commercial and retail spending by a whopping 25%. Using simple machine learning tricks, I built a smooth model system from scratch, ensuring our predictions hit the mark. But that's not all! I also delved into our data, uncovering hidden treasures and fine-tuning our approach. Working alongside my fantastic team, we used our tech know-how to hit our big targets and turn budget planning into a success story. Armed with my forecasting skills and a dash of teamwork, I turned budget blues into an epic win.</p>

									<h3>Data Scientist</h3>
									<p> Black Eye Technologies</p>
									<span class="date">June 2018 - Dec 2020</span>
									<p>Imagine diving into the world of image classification like a boss. With a sprinkle of magic, I streamlined deployment pipelines, cutting time by a staggering 40%. But that's not all - I also got creative with data visualization, whipping up interactive BI dashboards that made data more accessible and fun. The result? A big boost in user engagement and faster decision-making, all thanks to my handy work. And you know what kept me going? My thirst for knowledge!</p>

									<a href="https://github.com/aval-s/ENERGY-CONSUMPTION-PREDICTION" class="image fit"><img src="images/energy.webp" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In the realm of energy management, I've mastered the art of prediction. Picture this: using ML algorithms, I've unlocked the secret to forecasting commercial building energy consumption with a jaw-dropping 87% accuracy, leaving the competition in awe. But I didn't stop there. I brought the data to life using Tableau, crafting captivating visuals that turn numbers into actionable insights. It's not just about crunching numbers; it's about writing the story of efficiency and innovation, one algorithm at a time.</p>

									<a href="https://github.com/aval-s/PREDICTING-PEDIATRIC-SLEEP-PATTERNS" class="image fit"><img src="images/baby.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In the world of data handling, I've set up pipelines to make sense of complex information. I've taken PhysioNet data, cleaned it up, and made sure everything's in order with the proper permissions. Then, using a decision tree regressor model, I dug into sleep patterns, predicting with remarkable accuracy at 93.86%. It's about turning data into real insights that make a difference.</p>

										<h2><a href="https://github.com/aval-s/Underground-Water-Level-Prediction">UNDERGROUND WATER LEVEL PREDICTION USING TIME SERIES FORECASTING</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/aval-s/Underground-Water-Level-Prediction" class="image fit"><img src="images/well.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In my work with water resources, I've tapped into some pretty sophisticated tools – ARIMA and SARIMA models – to predict underground water levels. But it's not all about fancy algorithms; I've also dug deep into the data with both single and double-variable analyses to really understand what's going on. Using tools like seaborn and matplotlib, I've painted a clear picture of the trends and patterns hidden within. And because I believe in looking ahead, I've built a solid predictive model spanning five years into the future. Oh, and to make it all user-friendly, I've whipped up a simple interface using Tkinter. Because when it comes to managing water, accessibility is key.</p>
